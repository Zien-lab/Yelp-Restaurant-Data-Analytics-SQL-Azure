📊 Yelp Restaurant Data Analytics with SQL & Azure
This project leverages Yelp restaurant data to identify optimal locations, timings, and business types for setting up a new restaurant. By importing and transforming Yelp data from Kaggle into a cloud SQL environment, the project provides valuable insights for data-driven restaurant market strategy.

🚀 Project Overview
Objective: Analyze restaurant business data to determine the right place, time, and type of restaurant to establish for market success.

Data Source: Yelp Dataset from Kaggle

🧱 Data Engineering & ETL Pipeline
Imported over 6.5 million Yelp JSON records into Azure SQL Database.

Designed and normalized the schema into 8 optimized SQL tables based on Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data consistency.

Utilized Pandas and SQLAlchemy to:

Flatten deeply nested JSON attributes.

Optimize variable types.

Automate batch uploads and transformation pipelines.

📉 Achieved ~80% reduction in data redundancy and identified top 20.06% most valuable businesses.

🔍 Data Analysis Highlights
Developed complex SQL queries to analyze:

✅ Restaurant categories and business types.

🗣️ Consumer sentiment and review patterns.

⏰ Peak operational days and hours (e.g., Friday and Saturday, 5 PM to midnight).

🏙️ Performance comparisons across 1,000+ cities.

🔎 Key Insight Example
Tucson has a low average rating (3.74) but a high volume of reviews (250k+), indicating strong demand with quality improvement opportunities—making it a promising location for launching a new restaurant.
