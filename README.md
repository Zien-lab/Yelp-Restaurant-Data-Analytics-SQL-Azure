# Yelp-Restaurant-Data-Analytics-SQL-Azure-
This is a project using Yelp restaurant data to do analytics to know right places, right time, right business type to set up a new restaurant

## Imported Kaggle Yelp data into Azure, adjusted variable attributes and normalized the schema to ensure data consistency, structuring over 6.5 million JSON records into 8 optimized SQL tables based on 3NF principles.
## Used Pandas and SQL Alchemy for ETL pipeline, flattened nested JSON attributes, optimized data types, and automated batch uploads, reduced data redundancy about 80%, and analyzed the most valuable 20.06% of businesses.
## Developed SQL queries to analyze restaurant categories, consumer sentiment, and peak days and hours (Friday and Saturday, 5pm to midnight) across 1,000+ cities, provided insights to support data-driven market positioning. For example, we find Tucson's average rating is low (3.74) but it has lots of reviews (250k), which means we can set up a new restaurant.
